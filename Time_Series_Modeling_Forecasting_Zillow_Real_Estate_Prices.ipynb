    "### Introduction\n",
    "In 2021, the real estate industry in the United States was valued at USD 3.69 trillion and was expected to experience a 5.2% compound interest growth for the period between 2022 and 2030. This potential predicted growth of the industry, coupled with rising population rates in the US create a huge lucrative opportunity potential for real estate investors to make huge profits provided they <b>manage risk</b> and <b>make the right investments</b>.<br>\n",
    "According to <a href= 'https://www.peoplescapitalgroup.com/average-roi-real-estate/'>People's Capital Group</a>, residential properties have an average annual return of 10.6% and commercial properties have a 9.5% average return."

    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "The stakeholder in this project is a real estate investment firm that is looking to construct residential homes in top five locations in the US that would provide a high return on their investment. This project therefore is a time series analysis on a Zillow dataset on various locations around the United States.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will involve analyzing the house sale prices from 1996 to 2018 to determine the top five locations with the highest Return on Investment (ROI).<br>\n",
    "The stakeholder is also risk-averse and therefore the project involves recommending locations with low price volatility which can easily be predicted with the model.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In our time series analysis, the metric of success to determine model viability will be RMSE/MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Scope\n",
    "The primary goal of this project will be to conduct a time series analysis to predict the five best locations to invest in based on ROI."
